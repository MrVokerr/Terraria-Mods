Easily hide or show your buff bar with a single keypress!

Toggle Buff Bar is a lightweight client-side utility mod that adds a customizable hotkey to hide or show all active buffs and debuffs on the HUD. Perfect for players who want a cleaner interface for screenshots, videos, or just general gameplay.

- Default toggle key: B (can be changed in Controls → Mod Controls)
- Buff effects still apply — only the UI is hidden!
- Purely visual — no gameplay impact and 100% client-side
- Works seamlessly with modded buffs and debuffs
